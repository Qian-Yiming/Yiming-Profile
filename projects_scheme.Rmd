# Ultimate goal: faculty in the university setting!
## Mean: 
### publish MORE valuable papers
### figure out the research interests

***
## Other concerns:
- Get involved in the ASD research (ask for the research opportunities)
    - Possible faculty: Diana Williams, Suzy Scherf, Krista Wilkinson, etc.
    -	Apply for the Autism Speaks Predoctoral fellowship on Feb 27, 2020
-	Rick does not have on-going project now. 	
    -	Think hard of the possible research ideas which can be conducted in the near future and collect the pilot data
    -	Ask Rick whether it is possible to write a proposal together
-	Get prepared for the dissertation award- summer 2021
-	I found the faculty in ESM conducting some interesting neural computational research. Try to reach them (Dr. Bruce Gluckman, Dr. Xiao Liu)
